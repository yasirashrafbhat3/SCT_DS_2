Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice

Here we used the dataset named "Customer_Data.xlsx". In the dataset we have performed the data cleaning and Using the Customer_Data.xlsx data table I have created a Pie chart in Microsoft PowerBi to find the no. of orders taken place in different years visually.

Upon analysis from the data sheet, we have found that the high no of order is placed in the year 2015 and least no. of order placed in the year 2016
